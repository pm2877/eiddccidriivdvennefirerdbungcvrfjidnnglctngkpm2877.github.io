I am an experienced software developer currently working as anÂ SDE II at Yahoo Mail. I have a strong foundation in Computer Science, having completed my MS in CS from Columbia University, with a focus in Machine Learning. My industry experience and personal projects showcase my skills from across the stack.

I am an ambitious person who is extremely passionate about software engineering, loves collaboration and working with a team, and thrives on taking up new challenges and responsibilities.

More than anything, I love solving problems and building great products that make people's lives better. I have an inclination towards learning about new technologies like Virtual/Augmented Reality and Blockchain.

Music is a big part of my life. I am trained in Western Classical Music theory and piano. I am also learning to sing and play the Guitar.
