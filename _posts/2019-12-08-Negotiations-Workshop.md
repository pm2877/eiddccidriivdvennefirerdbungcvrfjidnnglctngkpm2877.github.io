1. If one party feels he/she has lost in a negotiation, then both the parties have lost!

2. Negotiate in packages, not item by item
3. Expand the pie by creating value, before dividing it
4. <img src="/Users/Parth/Desktop/Notes/image-20191208202303400.png" alt="image-20191208202303400" style="zoom:200%;" />

- Before negotiating, create an Aspiration Point package, with all the items that you want from the negotiation
- Create a resistance point, which is the minimum you want from this negotiation
- Create a BATNA, and also look at the counterpart's BATNA
- One approach during negotiations is: Create an aspiration package. Communicate what is important to you and talk about what is important to them. **Negotiate on the whole package and not item by item**
