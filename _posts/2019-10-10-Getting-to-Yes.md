Conflict is inevitable. You need to learn how to transform this conflict into side-by-side hard headed problem solving. A standard negotiation has only two stratgies: soft negotiation or hard negotiation. A soft negotiator wants to avoid personal conflicts and thus makes concessions readily to reach agreement. The hard negotiator views it as a contest of wills and ends up producing an equally hard response, which may harm the relationship with the other side. Both strategies leave people dissatisfied, worn out or alienated - and frequently all three.

There is a third way to negotiate which is both hard and soft - principled negotiation. The method of Principled Negotiation devleoped at the Harvard Negotiation Project is to decide issues on merits rather than through a process of haggling focused on what each side says it will and won't do. This method is hard on the merits, soft on the people. It is an all purpose strategy. Unlike almost all other strategies, if the other side learns it, it does not become, more difficult; it becomes easier.

### Don't bargain over Positions

People routinely engage in positional bargaining where each side takes a position, argues for it, and makes concessions to reach a compromise.

Any method of negotiation may be faitly judged by three criteria:

1. It should provide a wise agreement.
2. It should be efficient
3. It should improve, or atleast not damage the relationship between the parties.

A wise agreement can be defined as one that meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting issues fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account.

Positional bargaining fails to meet the basic criteria of producing a wise agreement, efficiently and amicably. Following are the downsides of positional bargaining:

1. Arguing over positions produces unwise outcomes

   Any agreement reached may reflect a mechanical splitting of the difference between the final positions rather than a solution carefully crafted to meet the legitimate interests of the parties.

2. Arguing over positions is inefficient

   Because both start with an extreme position, stubbornly hold to it, and make concessions only as necessary. It also involves a large number of decisions which is time consuming

3. It Arguing over positions endangers an ongoing relationship

   Because one side often sees itself bending to the rigid will of the other while its own legitiamate concerns go unaddressed.

4. When there are many parties, positional bargaining is even worse

5. Being nice is no answer

   It leaves you vulnerable to someone who is playing a hard negotiating game.



#### Principled Negotiation

This method can be boiled down to four basic points:

1. People - Separate the people from the problem
2. Interests - Focus on interests, not positions
3. Options - Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do
4. Criteria - Insist that the results be based on some objective criteria



### Separate the people from the problem

Failing to deal with others as human beings prone to human reactions can be disastrous. Every negotiator has two kinds of interests: in the substance and in the relationship. Disentangle the relationship from the substance; deal directly with the people problem. **Deal with people problems by changing how you treat people; don't try to solve them with substantive concessions.**

It is useful to think of people problems, in terms of three categories:

1. Perception
2. Emotion
3. Communication



#### Perception

Ultimately, conflict lies not in the objective reality, but in people's heads. Truth is simply one more argument for dealing with the difference. The difference itself exists because it exists in their thinking. As useful as looking for objective reality can be, it is ultimately the reality as each side sees it that constitutes the problem in a negotiation and also opens the way to a solution.

The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills a negotiator can possess. If you want to influence them, you also need to understand empathetically, the power of their point of view and to feel the emotional force with which they believe in it.

Points to keep in mind:

- Don't deduce their intentions from your fears

- Don't blame them for your problem

  Even if blaming is justified, it is usually counterproductive. Under attack, the other side will become defensive and will resist what you have to say.

- Discuss each other's perceptions

- Look for opportunities to act inconsistently with their perceptions

- Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process

  This is precisely what people tend to not do. When you have a difficult issue to handle, your instinct is to leave the last part until last. But if you want the other side to accept a disagreeable conclusion, it is crucial that you involve them in the process of reaching that conclusion.

- Face-saving

  Often in a negotiation people will continue to hold out not because the proposal on the table is inherently unacceptable, but simply because they want to avoid the feeling or the appearance of backing down to the other side. If the substance can be phrased or conceptualized differently so that it seems a fair outcome, they will then accept it. Face-saving involves reconciling an agreement with principle and with the self-image of the negotiators. Its importance should not be underestimated.



#### Emotion

Pay attention to <u>core concerns</u>. Many emotions in negotiations are driven by a core set of five interests:

1. Autonomy - The desire to make your own choices and control your own fate
2. Appreciation - The desire to be recognized and valued
3. Affiliation - The desire to belong as an accepted member of some peer group
4. Role - The desire to have a meaningful purpose
5. Status - The desire to be fairly seen and acknowledged

Trampling on these interests tends to generate strong negative emotions. Attending to them can build rapport and a positive climate for problem-solving negotiation.

Points to keep in mind:

- Consider the role of identity

  More specifically, percieved threat to identiy - one's self-image or self-respect

- Make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate

- Allow the other side to let off steam

  People obtain psychological release through the simple process of recounting their grievances to an attentive audience

- Don't react to emotional outbursts

  Adopt a rule that only one person can get angry at a time

- Use symbolic gestures



#### Communication

There are three big problems in communication:

1. Negotiators may not be talking to each other. Instead, they talk merely to impress third parties or their own constituency.
2. Even if one is talking directly to the other, the other might not be listening. Instead, he might be busy thinking what to say next, how to respond to that last point or how to frame the next argument, or he may be listening more attentively to his constitiuency than the other side.
3. What one says, the other might misunderstand

What to do about these problems?

1. Listen actively and acknowledge what is being said

   Active listening improves not only what you hear but also what they say. If you pay attention and interrupt to say, "Did I understand correctly that you are saying that…?", the other side will realize that they are not just killing time, not just going through a routine. It has been said that the cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.

   

   Show that you understand them. "Let me see whether I follow what you are telling me. From your point of view, the situation looks like this…". As you repeat what you understood them to have said, phrase it positively from their point of view, making the strength of their case clear. You might say, "You have a strong case. Let me see if I can explain it. Here's the way it strikes me…". Once you have made their case for them, then come back with the problems you find in their proposals. If you can put their case better than they can, and then refute it, you maximize the chance of initiating a constructive dialogue on the merits and minimize the chance of their believing you have misunderstood them.

2. Speak to be understood

   The person you are trying to persuade is seated at the table with you. If a negotiation is to be compared with a legal proceeding, the situation resembles that of two judges trying to reach an agreement on how to decide a case.

3. Speak about yourself, not about them

   It is more persuasive, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: "I feel let down" instead of "You broke your word". "We feel discriminated against", rather than "You're a racist". If you make a statement about them that they believe is untrue, they will ignore you or get angry; they will not focus on your concern. But a statement about how you feel is difficult to challenge. You convey the same information without provoking a defensive reaction that will prevent them from taking it in.

4. Speak for a purpose

   Before making a significant statement, know what you want to communicate or find out, and what purpose this information will serve.



### Focus on Interests, not Positions

For a wise solution, reconcile interests, not positions.

#### Interests define the problem

The basic problem in a negotiation lies not in conflicting positions, but in the conflict between each side's needs, desires, concerns, and fears. Such desires and concerns are interests. Interests motivate people; they are the silent movers behind the hubbub of positions. Your position is something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide.

Reconciling interests rather than positions works for two reasons:

1. For every interest there usually exist several possible positions that could satisfy it. All too often people simply adopt the most obvious position. When you do look behind opposed positions for the motivating interests, you can often find an alternative position that meets not only your interests but theirs as well.
2. Behind opposed positions lie many more interests than conflicting ones. There lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.



#### How do you identify interests

A position is likely to be concrete and explicit; the interests underlying it may well be unexpressed, intangible, and perhaps inconsistent.

1. Ask "Why?"

   One basic technique is to put yourself in their shoes. Examine each position they take, and ask yourself "Why?"

2. Ask "Why not?" Think about their choice

   One of the most useful ways to uncover interests is first to identify the basic decision that those on the other side probably see you asking them for, and then to ask yourself why they have not made that decision. What interest of theirs stand in the way?

3. Realize that each side has multiple interests

   Whether it is their emloyer, client, employees, colleagues, family, or spouse, all negotiators have a constituency to whose interests are sensitive. To understand a negotiator's interests means to understand the variety of somewhat differing interests that they need to take into account.

4. The most powerful interests are basic human needs, including:

   - security
   - economic well-being
   - a sense of belonging
   - recognition
   - control over one's life

5. Make a list

   To sort out the various interests of each side, it helps to write them down as they occur to you. This will not only help you remember them; it will also enable you to improve the quality of your assessment as you learn new information and to place interests in their estimated order of importance. Furthermore, it may stimulate ideas for how to meet these interests.



#### Talking about interests

The purpose of negotiating is to serve your interests. The chance of that happening increases when you communicate them.

1. Make you interests come alive

   If you go with a raging ulcer to see a doctor, you should not hope for much relief if you describe it as a mild stomachache. It is your job to have the other side understand exactly how important and legitimate your interests are. One guideline is to be specific. Concrete details not only make your description credible, they add impact.

   Part of the task of impressing the other side with your interests lies in establishing the legitimacy of those interests. You want them to feel not that you are attacking them personally, but rather that the problem you face legitimately demands attention. You need to convince them that they might well feel the same way if you were in your shoes.

2. Acknowledge their interests as part of the problem

   People listen better if they feel that you have understood them. They tend to think that those who understand them are intelligent and sympathetic people whose own opinions may be worth listening to. In addition to demonstrating that you have understood their interests, it helps to acknowledge that their interests are part of the overall problem you are trying to solve. This is especially easy to do if you have shared interests.

3. Put the problem before your answer

   If you want someone to listen and understand your reasoning, give your interests and reasoning first, and your conclusions or proposals later.

4. Look forward, not back

   Instead of arguing with the other side about the past, talk about what you want to have happen in the future.

5. Be concrete but flexible

   To keep your flexibility, treat each option you formulate as simlply illustrative. Think in terms of more than one option that meets your interests. Much of what positional bargainers hope to achieve with an opening position can be accomplished equally well with an illustrative suggestion that generously takes care of your interest. 

   > For example, in a sports contract negotiation, an agent might say that $500,000 a year would be the kind of money that should satisfy Henderson's interest in receiving the salary he feels he is worth. Something of the order of a five-year contract should meet his need for job-security

   Having thought about your interests, you should go into a meeting not only with one or more specific options that would meet your legitimate interests but also with an open mind. An open mind is not an empty one.

6. Be hard on the problem, soft on the people

   ***You can be just as hard in talking about your interests as any negotiator can be in talking about their position. In fact, it is usually advisable to be hard. It may not be wise to commit yourself to your position, but it is wise to commit yourself to your interests.***

   This is the place in a negotiation to spend your aggressive energies. Often the wisest solutions, those that produce the maximum gain for you at the minimum cost to the other side, are produced only by strongly advocating your interests. Two negotiators, each pushing hard for their interests, will often stimulate each other's creativity in thinking up mutually advantageous solutions.

   It is important to separate the people from the problem and attack the problem without blaming the people. Go even further and be personally supportive. **This combination of support and vigour may seem inconsistent. Psychologically, it is; the inconsistency helps make it work. A well-known theory of psychology, the theory of cognitive dissonance, holds that people dislike inconsistency and will act to eliminate it.**

   Successful negotiation requires being both firm and open.



### Invent Options for Mutual Gains

Skill at inventing options is one of the most useful assets a negotiator can have. Expand the pie before dividing it. In most negotiations there are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options:

#### Premature judgement

Nothing is so harmful to inventing as a critical sense waiting to pounce on the drawbacks of any new idea. Judgement hinders imagination. Under the pressure of a forthcoming negotiation, your critical sense is likely to be sharper. Practical negotiation appears to call for practical thinking, not wild ideas.

#### Searching for the single answer

The first impediment to creative thinking is premature crticism, the second is premature closure. By looking from the outset for the single best answer, you are likely to short-circuit a wiser decision-making process in which you select from a large number of possible answers.

#### The assumption of a fixed pie

Why bother to invent at all if all the options are obvious and I can satisfy you only at my own expense?

#### Thinking that solving their problem is their problem

Short-sighted self concern thus leads a negotiator to develop only partisan positions, partisan arguments, and one-sided solutions.

Following are the solutions to these problems:

#### Separate inventing from deciding

Since judgement hinders imagination, separate the creative act from the critical one; separate the process of thinking up possible decisions from the process of selecting among them. Invent first, decide later. As a negotiator, you will of necessity do much inventing by yourself. By definition, inventing new ideas requires you to think about things that are not already in your head. You should therefore consider the desirability of holding a brain-storming session with a few colleagues or friends. The group simply invents ideas without pausing to consider whether they are good, bad, realistic or unrealistic.

##### Guidelines for a successful brainstorming session

###### Before Brainstorming:

1. Define your purpose - Think of what you would like to walk out of the meeting with.
2. Choose a few participants - The group should usually be between five and eight people.
3. Change the environment - Select a time and place distinguishing the session as much as possible from regular discussions. The more different a brainstorming session seems from a normal meeting, the easier it is for participants to suspend judgement.
4. Design an informal atmosphere - What does it take for you and other to relax?
5. Choose a facilitator - Someone at the meeting needs to facilitate —> to keep the meeting on track, to make sure everyone gets a chance to speak, to enforce any ground rules, and to stimulate discussion by asking questions.

###### During Brainstorming:

1. Seat the participants side-by-side facing the problem

   The physical reinforces the psychological. Physically sitting side by side can reinforce the mental attitude of tacking a common problem together.

2. Clarify the ground rules, including the no-criticism rule.

   The meeting begins with introduction all around and clarification of ground rules. Outlaw negative criticism of any kind.

3. Brainstorm

   Once the purpose of the meeting is clear, let your imaginations go. Try to come up with a long list of ideas, approaching the question from every conceivable angle.

4. Record the ideas in full view

   Recording the ideas either on a whiteboard or flipcharts gives the group a tangible sense of collective achievement; it reinforces the no-criticism rule; it reduces the tendency to repeat; and it helps stimulate other ideas.

###### After Brainstorming:

1. Star the most promising ideas
2. Invent improvements for promising ideas
3. Setup a time to evaluate ideas and decide



#### Broaden your options

The key to wise decision-making lies in selecting from a great number and variety of options.

1. Multiply options by shuttling between the specific and the general: The Circle Chart

   ![IMG_3844](/Users/Parth/Desktop/Notes/IMG_3844.jpg)

2. Look through the eyes of different experts

   Generate multiple options by examining the problem from the perspective of different professions and disciplines

3. Invent agreements of different strengths

   You can multiply the number of possible agreements on the table by thinking of "weaker" versions you might want to have on hand in case a sought-for agreement proves beyond reach. Similarly, where a permanent agreement is not possible, perhaps a provisional agreement is. At the very least, if you and the other side cannot reach first-order agreement, you can usually reach second-order agreement — that is, agree on where you disagree, so that you both know the issues in dispute, which are not always obvious. 

4. Change the scope of a proposed agreement

   Agreements may be partial, involve fewer parties, cover only selected subject matters, apply only to a certain geographical area, or remain in effect for only a limited period of time.



#### Look for mutual gains

1. Identify shared interests

   In almost every case, your satisfaction depends to a degree on making the other side sufficiently content with an agreement to want to live up to it. Three points about shared interests are worth remembering. 

   First, shared interests lie latent in every negotiation. They may not be immediately obvious. Ask yourself: Do we have a shared interest in preserving our relationship? What opportunities lie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles, like a fair price, that we both can respect?

   Second, shared interests are opportunities, not godsends. To be of use, you need to make something out of them. It helps to make a shared interest explicit and to formulate it as a shared goal.

   Third, stressing your shared interests can make the negotiation smoother and more amicable.

2. Dovetail differing interests

   In many cases, a satisfactory agreement is made possible because each side wants different things. This is genuinely startling if you think about it. People generally assume that differences between two parties create the problem. Yet differences can also lead to a solution. Differences in interests and belief make it possible for an item to be of high benefit to you, yet low cost to the other side.

   - Different beliefs?
   - Different values placed on time?
   - Different predictions or forecasts?
   - Differences in aversion to risk?

   If dovetailing had to be summed up in one sentence, it would be: Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa. Differences in interests, priorities, beliefs, forecasts, and attitudes toward risk all make dovetailing possible.

3. Make their decisions easy

   However complex the other side's decisional process may seem, you will understand it better if you pick one person — probably the person with whom you are dealing — and see how the problem looks from his or her point of view. You may come to appreciate your negotiating role in a new light, and see your job, for example, as strengthening that person's hand or giving her arguments that she will need to persuade others to go along.

   ​	Take a pencil and paper in hand try drafting a few possible agreements. It is never too early in a negotiation to start drafting as an aid to clear thinking. Prepare multiple versions, starting with the simplest possible. What are some of the terms that the other party could sign, terms that would be attractive to them as well as to you? Can you reduce the number of people whose approval would be required? Can you formulate an agreement that will be easy for them to implement?

   ​	Because most people are strongly influenced be their notions of legitimacy, one effective way to develop solutions easy for the other side to accept is to shape them so that they will appear legitimate. The other side is more likely to accept a solution if it seems the right thing to do — right in terms of being fair, legal, honorable, and hence forth.

   ​	Few things facilitate a decision as much as precedent. Search for it. Look for a decision or statement that the other side may have made in a similar situation, and try to base a proposed agreement on it. This provides an objective standard for your request and makes it easier for them to go along. Recognizing their probable desire to be consistent, thinking about what they have already done or said will help you generate options acceptable to you that also take their point of view into account.

4. Making threats is not enough

   We often try to influence others by threats and warnings of what will happen if they do not decide as we would like. Offers are usually more effective. Concentrate both on making them aware of the consequences they can expect if they do decide as you wish and on improving those consequences from their point of view.

   To evaluate an option from the other side's point of view, consider how they might be criticized if they adopted it. Write out a sentence or two illustrating what the other side's most powerful critic might say about the decision you are thinking of asking for. Such an exercise will help you appreciate the restraints within which the other side is negotiating. It should help you generate options that will adequately meet their interests so that they can make a decision that meets yours.

   A final test of an option is to write it out in the form of a "yes able proposition." Try to draft a proposal to which their responding with the single word "yes" would be sufficient, realistic, and operational. When you can do so, you will have reduced the risk that you immediate self-interest has blinded you to the necessity of meeting concerns of the other side.

**In summary, generate many options before selecting among them. Invent first; decide later. Look for shared interests and differing interests to dovetail. And seek to make their decision easy.**

### Insist on Using Objective Criteria

The approach is to commit yourself to reaching a solution based on principle, not pressure. Concentrate on the merits of the problem, not the mettle of the parties. Be open to reason, but closed to threats.

#### Principled negotiation produces wise agreements amicably and efficiently

The more you bring standards of fairness, efficiency, or scientific merit to bear on your particular problem, the more likely you are to produce a final package that is wise and fair. The more you and the other side refer to precedent and community practice, the greater your chance of benefitting from past experience. And an agreement consistent with precedent is less vulnerable to attack.

A constant battle for dominance threatens a relationship; principled negotiation protects it. It is far easier to deal with people when both of you are discussing objective standards for settling a problem instead of trying to force each other to back down.

Approaching agreement through discussion of objective criteria also reduces the number of commitments that each side must make and then unmake as they move toward agreement. In positional bargaining, negotiators spend much of the time defending theri position and attacking the other side's. People using objective criteria tend to use time more efficiently talking about possible standards and solutions.

#### Developing objective criteria

How do you develop objective criteria, and how do you use them in negotiating?

Whatever method of negotiation you use, you will do better if you prepare in advance. This certainly holds true of principled negotiation. So develop some alternative standards beforehand and think through their application to your case.

1. Fair standards

   At a minimum, objective criteria need to be independent of each side's will. Ideally, to assure a wise agreement, objective criteria should not be only independent of will but also both legitimate and practical.

2. Fair procedures

   Consider, for example, the age-old way to divide a piece of cake between two children; one cuts and the other chooses. Neither can complain about an unfair division. A variation on the procedure of "one cuts, the other chooses" is for the parties to negotiate what they think is a fair arrangement before they go on to decide their respective roles in it. As you consider procedural solutions, look at other basic means of settling differences: taking turns, drawing lots, letting someone else decide, and so on. The results may be unequal, but each side had an equal opportunity.

#### Negotiating with objective criteria

There are 3 basic points to remember:

1. Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria.

   - Ask "What's your theory?"

   - Agree first on principles

     Each principle or standard the other side proposes becomes a lever you can then use to persuade them. Your case will have more impact if it is  presented in terms of ther criteria, and they will find it difficult to resist applying their criteria to the problem. What makes conceding particularly difficult is having to accept someone else's proposal. If they suggested the standard, their deferring to it is not an act of weakness but an act of strength, of carrying out their word.

2. Reason and be open to reason as to which standards are most appropriate and how they should be applied.

3. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.

   Pressure can take many forms: a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust, or a simple refusal to budge. In all these cases, the princpled response is the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.

### What if they are more powerful

In any negotiation there exist realities that are hard to change. In response to power, the most any method of negotiation can do is to meet two objectives: first, to protect you against making an agreement you should reject and second, to help you make the most of the assets you do have so that any agreement you reach will satisfy your interests as well as possible.

#### Protecting yourself

1. The cost of using a bottom line

   Your predetermined bottom line may save you from making a decision you would later regret. But the protection offered by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what you learn during negotiation. A bottom line also inhibits imagination. It reduces the incentive to invent a tailor-made solution that would reconcile differing interests in a way more advantageous for both you and them. A bottom line — by its very nature rigid — is almost certain to be too rigid.

2. Know your **BATNA**

   The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating. What are your results? What is that alternative? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured. Your BATNA not only is a better measure but also has the advantage of being flexible enough to permit the exploration of imaginative solutions. Instead of ruling out any solution that does not meet your bottom line, you can compare a proposal with your BATNA to see whether it better satisfies your interests.

3. The insecurity of an unknown BATNA

   If you have not thought carefully about what you will do if you fail to reach an agreement, you are negotiating with your eyes closed. You may, for instance, be too optimistic and assume that you have many other choices. One frequent mistake is psychologically to see your alternatives in the aggregate. In most circumstances, however, the greater danger is that you are too committed to reaching agreement. Not developed any alternative to a negotiated solution, you are unduly pessimistic about what would happen if negotiations broke off.

4. Formulate a trip wire

   Although your BATNA is your true measure by which you should judge any proposed agreement, you may want another test as well. To give you early warning that the content of a possible agreement is beginning to run the risk of being too unattractive, it is useful to identify one far from perfect agreement that is better than your BATNA. Before accepting any agreement worse than the trip-wire package, you should take a break and reexamine the situation. A trip wire should provide you with some margin in reserve.



#### Making the most of your assets

1. The better your BATNA, the greater your power

   People think of negotiating power as being determined by resources like wealth, political connections, physical strength, friends, and military might. In fact, relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement. Think for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers — only some uncertain leads. Think how the talk about salary would go. Now contrast that with how you would feel walking in with two other job offers. How would that salary negotiation proceed? The difference is power.

2. Develop your BATNA

   Vigorous exploration of what you do if you do not reach agreement can greatly strengthen your hand. Attractive alternatives are not just sitting there waiting for you; you usually have to develop them. Generating possible BATNAs requires three distinct operations.

   - Inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached
   - Improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives
   - Selecting, tentatively, the one alternative that seems best

   The desirability of disclosing your BATNA to the other side depends on your assessment of the other side's thinking. If your BATNA is extremely attractive — if you have another customer waiting in the next room — it is in your interest to let the other side know. If they think you lack a good alternative when in fact you have one, then you should almost certainly let them know. However, if your best alternative to a negotiated agreement is worse for you than they think, disclosing it will weaken rather than strengthen your hand.

3. Consider the other side's BATNA

   You should also think about the alternatives to a negotiated agreement available to the other side. The more you can learn of their alternatives, the better prepared you are for negotiation. Knowing their alternatives, you can realistically estimate what you can expect from the negotiation. If they appear to overestimate their BATNA, you will want to help them think through whether their expectations are realistic. If their BATNA is so good they don't see any need to negotiate on the merits, consider what you can do to change it.

   If both sides have attractive BATNAs, the best outcome of the negotiation — for both parties — may well be not to reach agreement. In such cases, a successful negotiation is one in which you and they amicably and efficiently discover that the best way to advance your respective interests is for each of you to look elsewhere and not to try further to reach agreement.

4. When the other side is powerful

   If the other side has big guns, you do not want to turn a negotiation into a gunfight. The stronger they appear in terms of physical or economic power, the more you benefit by negotiating on the merits. To the extent that they have muscle and you have principle, the larger a role you can establish for principle the better off you are. The more easily and happily you can walk away from a negotiation, the greater your capacity to affect its outcome.

   Developing your BATNA thus not only enables you to determine what is a minimally acceptable agreement, it will probably raise that minimum. Developing your BATNA is perhaps the most effective course of action you can take in dealing with a seemingly more powerful negotiator.



### What if they won't play?

You may attack the problem on its merits; they may attack you. What can you do to turn them away from positions and toward the merits? There are 3 basic approaches for focusing ther attention on the merits. The first centers on what you can do. You yourself can concentrate on the merits, rather than on positions. This is contagious. If this doesn't work, and they continue to use positional bargaining, you can resort to a second strategy that focuses on what they may do. It counters the basic moves of positional bargaining in ways that direct their attention to the merits. This strategy is called **negotiation jujitsu**. The third approach focuses on what a third party can do. If neither of the first two approaches work, consider including a third party trained to focus the discussion on interests,  options and criteria.

#### Negotiation Jujitsu

If the other side announces a firm position, you may be tempted to criticize and reject it. If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to defend it and dig yourself in. If they attack you, you may be tempted to defend yourself and counterattack. In short, if they push hard, you will tend to push back.

Yet if you do, you will end up playing the positional bargaining game. DO NOT PUSH BACK.

When they assert their positions, do not reject them. When they attack your ideas, don't defend them. When they attack you, don't counterattack. Break the viscious cycle by refusing to react. Instead of pushing back, sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem. As in the Oriental martial arts of judo and jujitsu, avoid pitting your strength against theirs directly; instead, use your skill to step aside and turn their strength to your ends. Rather than resisting their force, channel it into exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.

Typically their attack will consist of three maneuvers: asserting their position forcefully, attacking your ideas, and attacking you.

1. Don't attack their position, look behind it

   Seek out and discuss the principles underlying the other side's positions. To direct their attention toward improving the options on the table, discuss with them hypothetically what would happen if one of their positons was accepted.

2. Don't defend your ideas, invite criticism and advice

   A lot of time in negotiation is spent criticizing. Rather than resisting the other side's criticism, invite it. Instead of asking them to accept or reject an idea, ask them what's wrong with it. Examine their negative judgements to find out their underlying interests and to improve your ideas from their point of view. Rework your ideas and thus turn criticism from being an abstacle in the process of working toward agreement into an essential ingredient of that process.

   Another way to channel criticism in a constructive direction is to turn the situation around and ask for their advice. Ask them what they would do if they were in your position.

3. Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem

   When the other side attacks you personally — as frequently happens — resist the temptation to defend yourself or to attack them. Instead, sit back and allow them to let off steam, Listen to them, show you understand what they are saying, and when they have finished, recast their attack on you as an attack on the problem.

4. Ask questions and pause

   Those involved in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements. Statements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers. Silence is one of your best weapons, use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.

   If you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. Silence creates the impression of a stalemate that the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion. When you ask questions, pause. Don't take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.



#### Stock phrases you can use for principled negotiation

1. **"Please correct me if I'm wrong"**

2. **"We appreciate what you've done for us"**

3. **"My concern is fairness"**

4. "We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom"

5. **"Trust is a separate issue" — This is not a matter of trust. The issue is the principle**

6. "Could I ask you a few questions to see whether my facts are right?"

7. **"What's the principle behind your action?"**

8. "Let me see if I understand what you're saying"

9. **"Let me get back to you"**

10. "Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasoning"

11. "One fair solution might be..."

12. **"It's been a pleasure dealing with you"**

13. "If we agree… if we disagree…"

    The trickiest part of the message to communicate is the alternative if no agreement is reached. Try to base the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to someone else. Distance yourself personally from the suggestion. Don't state it as if you will definitely take action. Instead, leave it as a possibility and emphazise the reluctance to do anything drastic. Finally, try to close by affirming your confidence that a mutually satisfactory agreement will be reached

    

### What if they use dirty tricks

Tricky bargaining tactics are in effect one-sided proposals about negotiating procedure, about the negotiating game that the parties are going to play. To counter them, you will want to engage in principled negotiation about the negotiating process.

#### How do you negotiate about the rules of the game?

Often just recognizing a tactic will neutralize it. After recognizing the tactic, consider bringing it up with the other side. Apart from that, consider this a meta negotiation and follow the same steps:

- Separate the people from the problem
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Invent options for mutual gain
- Insist on using objective criteria

#### Some common tricky tactics

Tricky tactics can be divided into three categories: deliberate deception, psychological warfare, and positional pressure tactics

1. Deliberate deception - Misinterpretation of facts, authority or intentions

   - Phony facts

     Unless you have good reason to trust somebody, don't. Do not let someone treat your doubtsas a personal attack. A practice of verifying factual assertions reduces the incentive for deception, and your risk of being cheated.

   - Ambiguous authority

     The other side may allow you to believe that they, like you, have full authority to compromise whn they don't. Before starting on any give-and-take, find out about the authority on the other side. It is perfectly legitimate to inquire, "Just how much authority do you have in this particular negotiation?" If the answer is ambiguous, you may wish to talk to someone with real authority or to make clear that you on your side are reserving equal freedom to reconsider any point.

   - Dubious intentions

     Where the issue is one of possible misrepresentation of their intentions to comply with the agreement, it is often possible to build compliance features into the agreement itself. **Make the problem explicit and use their protestations to get a guarantee.**

   - Less than full disclosure is not the same as deception

     Good faith negotiation does not require total disclosure

2. Psychological warfare

   These tactics are designed to make you feel uncomfortable, so that you will have a subconscious desire to end the negotiation as soon as possible

   - Stressful situations

     If you find the physical surroundings detrimental, do not hesitate to say so. You can suggest changing chairs, taking a break, or adjourning to a different location or another time.

   - Personal attacks

     Recognizing the tactic will help nullify its effect; bringing it up explicitly will probably prevent a recurrence.

   - The good-guy/bad-guy routine

     If you recognize it, you won't be taken in. When the good guy makes his pitch, just ask him the same question you asked the bad guy.

   - Threats

     You can ignore threats; you can take them as unauthorized, spoken in haste, or simply irrelevant. You can also make it risky for the other side to communicate them. Sometimes, threats can also be turned to you political advantage.

3. Positional pressure tactics

   This kind of bargaining tactic is designed to structure the situation so that only one side can effectively make concessions.

   - Refusal to negotiate

     This is a negotiating ploy that attempts to use their entry into negotiation as a bargaining chip to obtain some concession on substance. You can communicate, suggest optionsand insist on using principles.

   - Extreme demands

     Bringing the tactic to their attention works well. Ask for principled justification of their position until it looks ridiculous even to them.

   - Escalating demands

     Call it to their attention, and take a break. Insist on using principle.

   - Lock-in tactics

     Lock-ins, like threats, depend on communication. So, you may be able to interrupt the communication to make it ineffective. Alternatively, you can crack a joke and not take the lock-in seriously.

   - Hardhearted partner/boss

     Recognize the tactic. Rather than discussing it with the other negotiator, you may want to get his agreement to the principle involved involved — perhaps in writing — and then if possible speak directly with the hardhearted partner.

   - A calculated delay

     In addition to making delaying tactics explicit and negotiating about them, consider creating a fading oppotunity for the other side.

   - Take it or leave it

     As an alternative to explicitly recognizing the "take it or leave it" tactic and negotiating about it, consider ignoring it at first. Keep talking as if you didn't hear it, or change the subject, perhaps by introducing other solutions. If you do bring up the tactic specifically, let them know what they have to lose if no agreement is reached and look for a face-saving way, such as a change in circumstances, for them to get out of the situation.



### Questions

#### "Can the way I negotiate really make a difference if the other side is more powerful?" AND "How do I enhance my negotiating power?"

—> How you negotiate (and how you prepare to negotiate) can make an enormous difference, whatever the relative strengths of each party.

##### 1. Some things you can't get

You should not expect success in negotiation unless you are able to make the other side an offer they find more attractive than their BATNA. If that seems impossible, then negotiation doesn't make sense. Concentrate instead on improving your BATNA and perhaps changing theirs.

##### 2. How you negotiate makes a big difference

In a situation where there is a chance for agreement, the way you negotiate can make the difference between coming to terms and not, or between an outcome that you find favorable and one that is merely acceptable. How you negotiate may determine whether the pie is expanded or merely divided, and whether you have a good relationship with the other side or a strained one. When the other side holds all the cards, how you negotiate is absolutely critical.

##### 3. Resources are not the same as "negotiation power"

Negotiation power is the ability to persuade someone to do something. The United States is rich and has lots of nuclear bombs, but neither has been of much help in deterring terrorist actions or freeing hostages when they have been held. Whether your resources give you negotiating power will depend on the context — on whom you are trying to persuade and what you want them to do.

##### 4. Don't ask who's more powerful

Trying to estimate whether you or your counterparts are more powerful can be risky. In fact, a great deal can be done to ehance your negotiation power even when the resource balance is one-sided. Of course, there will be negotiations where, at least in the short term, the best cards are held by the other side. But in this increasingly interdependent world, there are almost always resources and potential allies that a skilled and persistent negotiator can exploit, at least to move the fulcrum, if not ultimately to tip the balance of power the other way. You won't find out what's possible unless you try.

**The best rule of thumb is to be optimistic — to let your reach exceed your grasp. Without wasting a lot of resources on hopeless causes, recognize that many things are worth trying for even if you may not succeed. Studies of negotiation consistently show a strong correlation between aspiration and result. Within reason, it pays to think positively.**

##### 5. There are many sources of negotiation power

Negotiation power has a lot of sources. One is having a good BATNA. Provided they believe you, it is persuasive to tell the other side that you have a better alternative.

- There is power in developing a good working relationship between the people negotiating

  If you understand the other side and they understand you, negotiations are likely to be smoother and more successful for both parties. In this sense, negotiation power is not a zero-sum phenomenon. More negotiation power for the other side does not necessarliy mean less for you.

- There is power in effective communication

  **Good communication is an especially significant source of negotating power. Crafting your message with punch, listening to the other side, and showing that you have heard can all increase your persuasiveness.**

  It is comparatively easy to listen when the other side is saying something that you agree with. It is harder to listen to things with which you disagree, but that is the very time it is most effective. Listen before you launch into a rebuttal. Inquire. Make sure you understand their view, and make sure they know you understand. Once the other side knows that you understand what they have said, they cannot dismiss your disagreement as simple lack of understanding.

  As we know, recognizing a tactic or move allows us to name it and begin an explicit negotiation process. Another way to "change the game" is to change the frame. In other words, move focus in the negotiation from positions to interests, options, or standards. If the other side says, for example, "$10,000 is the most we will pay," when you think \$50,000 would be fair, you could respond in several ways:

  1. Reframe to interests: "I hear that is your position. Given how far that seems below the market price, help me understand your interests. Are you experiencing a serious cash flow crisis?"
  2. Reframe to options: "10,000 is one option, just as $100,000 or \$200,000 would be attracive options from our point of view. I think we'll get a lot further brainstorming options likely to be acceptable and attractive to both of us. What if we were to…?"
  3. Reframe to standards: "You must have good reasons for thinking $10,000 is a fair offer. How did you arrive at that number? Why that number, instead of, say \$0 or \$100,000? My understanding is that the market price is \$50,000. Why should we agree on less?"
  4. Reframe to BATNA: "Of course, that's your decision to make, and perhaps someone else will accept that. I think we need to think hard now about whether an agreement is possible here that would make sense for both of us."

  One of the greatest powers you have is to reframe, using statements and questions to change the focus of negotiation to interests, options and standards — and thus to change the game from postional bargaining to principled negotiation.

- There is power in understanding interests

  The more clearly you understand the other side's concerns, the better able you will be to satisfy them at minimum cost to yourself.

- There is power in inventing an elegant option

- There is power in using external standards of legitimacy

  You can use standards of legitimacy both as a sword to persuade others, and a shield to help you resist pressure to give in arbitrarily

- There is power in developing a good BATNA

  In addition to improving your overall BATNA, you shouldalso prepare a "micro-BATNA" — if no agreement is reached at THIS MEETING, what is the best outcome? It helps to draft in advance a good exit line to use if a meeting is inconclusive.

- There is power in making a carefully crafted commitment

  One additional source of persuasive power is the power of making committments. You can use a committment to enhance your negotiating power in three ways: You can commit to what you will do. You can, with care, make a negative committment as to what you will not do. And you can clarify precisely what commitments you would like the other side to make.

##### 6. Make the most of your potential power

To make the most of your potential negotiating power, you should use each source of power in harmony with the other sources. Negotiators sometimes look for their strongest source of power and try to use it alone. For example, if a negotiator has a strong BATNA, he or she may confront the other side with it, threatening to walk away unless the last offer is accepted. The total impact of such negotiation power as you have will be greater if each element is used in ways that reinforce the others.

You will also be more effective as a negotiator if you believe in what you are saying and doing. Whatever use you are able to make of the ideas in this book, don't wear them as though you were wearing someone else's clothes. Cut and fit what we say until you find an approach that both makes sense and is comfortable for you. This may require experimentation and a period od adjustment that is not so comfortable, but in the end, you are likely to maximize your negotiation power if you believe what you say and what you believe.
